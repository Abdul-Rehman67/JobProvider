    <h1>Job Provider</h1>
    <p>
       <q> On Job Provider, you network with people by adding them as "connections," similar to how you'd make a friend request on Facebook. You converse via private message (or available contact information) and you have all of your professional experience and achievements laid out in a neatly organized profile to show off to other users.

        Job Provider is similar to Facebook in terms of its layout and broad feature offering. These features are more specialized because the y cater to professionals, but in general, if you know how to use Facebook or any other similar social network, Job Provider is somewhat comparable.
